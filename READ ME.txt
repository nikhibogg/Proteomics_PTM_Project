This file contains information for all the items needed to run the various programs, results from running the program and any data analysis done.

Acetylation:

	MusiteDeep:
	- Only non-standard required library is Biopython
	- Run with "python ace_musite.py <input fasta>
	- The program will use the MusiteDeep web server to predict lysine acetylation in each protein of the input file that has 1000 AA or less
	with a confidence level of 0.5
	- The results will be output as a csv file with one column that lists the input header followed by a list of predicted residues.
	- Provided in the folder are the three Ace control datasets and their output when run with the script
	
	Sitetack:
	- After removing rows with low confidence levels, sitetack_data_transform.py will turn the CSV files output
	by the Sitetack webserver into a format usable by the "Parse_Ace_Tool_Output.py" script (in the Acetylation_Parsing folder)
	- Provided are the three files of Sitetack output ready to be run through the script
	- Simply type "python sitetack_data_transform.py <csv file>" to reformat the data
	
	to run GPS-PAIL, just make sure to install the program, that is all that is needed to get acetylation ptm sites
	GPS PAIL - Nikhi
	- Contains program
	
	For PTM GPT 2, make sure to install: torch, evaluate, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, transformers
	PTM_GPT_2_Acetylation - Nikhi
	- Contains script required to run it - scripts mainly modified Dakota, modified by Nikhi a little bit to make it work for Acteylation
	- Output
	- Filtered output to reformat into excel
	- Pull_Info script to format the output from PTM GPT 2
	- excel file with results from PTM GPT 2
	- not in folder but needed to run
		- fasta files

	Counting true/false positives/negatives for acetylation data:
	-
