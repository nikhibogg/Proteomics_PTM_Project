README

This contians the prediction date from MustiDeep that was converted into training data for Sitetack
The previously Identified combine_PTM'S.py scripts were used to convert these predictions from .txt to .xlsx.

The input.txt contains a log of the Fasta file input into the prediction tool.
No errors or issues occured with prediction limit, despite other people of Musitedeep apparently hitting a limit of protein length.
