`parse_pr_data.py` gets the "gi" ids from the s. pneumoniae phosphorylation paper along with the sequences for those ids. 


`musite.py` does phophorylation predictions for eveery protein in the s. pneumoniae and s. mutans proteomes. 


`ptmgpt2.py` does phophorylation predictions for every protein in the s. pneumoniae and s. mutans proteomes. (NOTE: requires external download since models are very large, https://github.com/pallucs/PTMGPT2)


`analysis.py` does the phosphorylation prediction breakdown.


`Positive_control_Sad.fasta` has the two phosphorylation positive control sites for s. mutans.


`sp_pos_con.csv` are the s. pneumoniae positive controls.


`sp_wp_map.csv` is generated by `analysis.py` and maps the "gi" id, GenBank Accession, UniProt Accession, and UniProt ID all to eachother.
